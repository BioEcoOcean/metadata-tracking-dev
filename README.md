![Resource Link Checked](https://github.com/NOAA-CEFI-Portal/CEFI-info-hub-list/actions/workflows/gha_check_link_daily.yml/badge.svg)

This repo is a test for generating metadata JSON-LD files for BioEco EOVs within the BioEcoOcean project. It is still in development.

The idea is to submit a new GitHub issue with the "Contribute BioEco Metadata" issue template, fill in the fields, submit, and then a JSON-LD file will be generated for you. The link to that JSON-LD file can then be used to link the metadata to ODIS.

Things to do:
- confirm JSON-LD files can be easily updated and doesn't create duplicates (so the link is stable)
- look into generating sitemap.xml
- update the resource link check badge
