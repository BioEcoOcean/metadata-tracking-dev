# BioEco resource list


This repo is a test for generating metadata JSON-LD files for BioEco EOVs within the [BioEcoOcean](https://bioecoocean.org/)project. It is still in development and because it was forked from the NOAA CEFI info hub repo there may still be unrelated info in this repo. Big thank you to the contributors who developed the original metadata generators this repo this is based on, their developments there are invaluable for this project! 

## How it (will) work
  
The idea is to submit a new GitHub issue with the "Contribute BioEco Metadata" issue template, fill in the fields, submit, and then JSON-LD files as well as a sitemap will be generated for you in a folder named according to your programme's title. The link to the sitemap file can then be used to link the metadata to ODIS through the [ODIS Catalgoue of Sources](https://catalogue.odis.org/). Metadata entered in this template will focus more on project metadata rather than dataset specific metadata, which will be associated with datasets published to [OBIS](https://obis.org/). 

### Metadata required
  
The following information should be included in any metadata file generated to ensure full interoperability and transparency. We encourage the use of controlled vocabulary as much as possible and incorporated places to provide such links in the template. 
- Project details: title, description, links 
- License 
- Point of contact(s) 
- EOV(s) targeted 
- Methods used 
- Taxonomic scope 
- Temporal scope 
- ...
