# BioEco resource list


This repo is a test for generating metadata JSON-LD files for BioEco EOVs within theon the information hub created for the NOAA Climate, Ecosystems, and Fisheries Initiative ([BioEcoOcean project](https://bioecoocean.org/). It is still in development and because it was forked from the NOAA CEFI info hub repothere may still be unrelated info in this repo. Big thank you to the contributors whodeveloped the original metadata generators this repo this is based on, their developments there are invaluable for this project! 

## How it (will) work
  
TThe idea is to submit a new GitHub issue with the "Contribute BioEco Metadata" issue template,fill in the fields, submit, and then a JSON-LD file will be generated for you. The link to thatJSON-LD file can then be used to link the metadata to ODIS through the [ODIS Catalgoue of Sources](https://catalogue.odis.org/). Metadata entered in this template will focus more on project metadata rather than dataset specific metadata, which will be associated with datasets published to[OBIS](https://obis.org/).
