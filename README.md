This repo is a test for generating metadata JSON-LD files for BioEco EOVs within the BioEcoOcean project. It is still in development.

The idea is to submit a new GitHub issue with the "Contribute BioEco Metadata" issue template, fill in the fields, submit, and then a JSON-LD file will be generated for you. The link to that JSON-LD file can then be used to link the metadata to ODIS.
JSON-LD files should be able to be easily updated.
